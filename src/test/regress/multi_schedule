# Regression tests that exercise distributed planning/execution functionality.
#
# All new regression tests are expected to be run by this schedule. Tests that
# do not set specific task executor type should also be added to
# multi_task_tracker_extra_schedule.
#
# Note that we use variant comparison files to test version dependent regression
# test results. For more information:

# Tests around schema changes, these are run first, so there's no preexisting objects.
#
# propagate_extension_commands lies just after multi_cluster_management as we do
# remove / add node operations, we do not want any preexisting objects before
# propagate_extension_commands
